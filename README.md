## Some change

# MythAPI

## Motivation

This repository was created to refresh on my .NET knowledge, better understand Docker and containerized apps, as well as GitHub Actions, and become more familiar with Microsoft's Entity Framework. The domain of the API was chosen more or less at random, as it wasn't deemed important for this project, and I wanted to get away from the old shop example.

# Walkthrough

# Creating the project

To create a base app to start of the project I used the command `dotnet new web -o MythApi -f net8.0`. Here I specify that I want to create a new project, following the `web` template and that it should use the framework `.NET 8.0`. Also specified is the name of the project, which in this case is `MythApi`. This gives us a brand new .NET api, which already follow the minimal API approach.
